                    Hi! I'm Jesse, and I'm current freshman at Columbia University pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science. My main interests academically 
                    lie in applications in computer science to urban fields with real-world, positive social impact, such as computational spatial design or analysis of 
                    dyanmic urban education planning. However, I always enjoy learning new things across all STEM fields, such as genetic sequencing and splicing in biology, 
                    kinetics of reactions in chemistry, or even anlyzing equipotential surfaces in physics. I always enjoy my daily dose of exploring new topics through YouTube 
                    channels such as Numberphile or Vsauce (I highly recommend these creators to anyone interested in acquiring knowledge across a breadth of various scientific 
                    ideas and theories). <br><br>
                    Outside of class, I enjoy many things which are physically extensive, which includes weekly pickup basketball games with friends and working out (I'm stil 
                    trying to find the sweet spot when no one else is at Dodge). I'm a member of Uptown Local, Columbia's men's ultimate frisbee team, and I definitely enjoy 
                    getting a breather from schoolwork a couple times a week to launch up and grab the disc in the end zone. I'm also a developer at SpecTech of The Spectator, 
                    Columbia's weekly newspaper, and I work on anything from creating web pages for special events, such as Freshman Orientation, to Chrome extensions, such 
                    as Vergil+ and The Shaft, which enhance Columbia students' processes in course registration and dorm selection, respectively. Finally, I've always loved 
                    teaching, and I'm currently an instructor at Idea Math in NYC and a grader for AoPS, but I've worked for many places, including Mathnasium and Awesome 
                    Math as well as my own tutoring initiatives. In my free time, I absolutely love coming up with unique math contest problems.<br><br>
                    Check out the <b>Awards</b> section for academic/extracurricular awards and honors I've earned, the <b>Activities</b> section for projects, initiatives, and 
                    activities I'm invovled with at Columbia and beyond, and the <b>Memories</b> section for a cool gallery!

                    <span class="medium" style="padding-bottom: 0"><b>Curiosity:</b></span> I spend a lot of time pondering things in both the microscopic and macroscopic worlds. 
                    Why is that pidgeon unafraid of anything? Why is the one-over-r-squared relationship so powerful? Did Fermat really prove his famous last theorem in an 
                    elegant way?<br>
                    <span class="medium" style="padding-bottom: 0"><b>Limit-Pushing:</b></span> No, I don't really enjoy taking a class that I wouldn't benefit or learn much from. 
                    I enjoy learning for the process, struggling, tinkering, and challenging-myself to build up my knowledge. I don't take the easy way out: I push through 
                    the finish line no matter how tired I am. <i>No pain no gain.</i><br>
                    <span class="medium" style="padding-bottom: 0"><b>Responsibility and Accountability:</b></span> As a member of numerous 'teams,' including my family, friend 
                    group, and basketball team, I have a responsibility and duty to those around me so that we can be the best that we can be. Everything I do will have 
                    an effect on those around me. <i>Give it your 110%, everyday.</i><br>
                    <span class="medium" style="padding-bottom: 0"><b>Gratitude:</b></span> The world around us isn't there from a wave of a wand. Our ancestors, past scientists, 
                    and activists have dedicated their lives to their betterment of the society so that we can be in the world that we are today. I wouldn't be anywhere without 
                    my parents, who've given their all to send me to basketball camps, math classes, and school on a daily basis. I couldn't imagine myself being in their shoes, 
                    immigrating from China to a foreign land with little money, english skills, and help in order to support their families back home.<br>
                    <span class="medium" style="padding-bottom: 0"><b>Passion:</b></span> When I solve solve math problems, I aboslutely love it. When I teach students number sense tricks, 
                    I am exhilerated. When I am coding for The Spectator, I put every bit of energy into it. I truly believe in purusing what you love with burning passion,

                    <span class="medium" style="padding-bottom: 0"><b>Open-Mindedness</b></span> It's so easy to get trapped within a narrow field of view in tackling a challenging math 
                    problem or discussing abortion rights. But I always remind myself to open my other ear, listen to what others have to say. We grow and evolve as a society 
                    by building off each other in open conversation. <i>Maybe I am wrong...</i><br>
                    <span class="medium" style="padding-bottom: 0"><b>Team-Oriented:</b></span> Being a bench warmer on a basketball team can undoubtedly be demotivating; I can 
                    definitely attest to that from personal experience. But look beyond yourself, not everything has to run through you. I try to be as supportive as I can 
                    be as a teammate and contribute in any way I can, which includes practicing hard and being the first one to jump off of the bench to get water for the 
                    starters and high-five them with authority. <i>Not everything's about me...</i><br>
                    <span class="medium" style="padding-bottom: 0"><b>Initiative-Driven:</b></span> I've grown to understand that nothing's going to get handed to you for free. If I 
                    want to make a website for math education, it's not going to make itself. If I want to actualize change in math education across our nation, I need to be 
                    the one who seeks out opportunities to teach and share ideas. If I want to do research in machine learning, I need to be the one who takes the time outside 
                    of class to learn concepts from the ground up and then contact professors.<br>
                    <span class="medium" style="padding-bottom: 0"><b>Health and Balance:</b></span> Especially as a student at a university with a heavy coursework, it's important for 
                    me to be able to maintain a balance of work/stress with relaxation and exercise. Keeping healthy and fit has always been a goal of mine, and I strive to not 
                    give into perpetual stress by overworking myself. There are other things in life than classes. People, food, basketball... Moreover, I do enjoy maintaining a 
                    healthy diet, avoiding junk food if I can in order to keep my body at the best it can be.<br>
