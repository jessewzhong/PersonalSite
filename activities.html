                    Coded my own full-stack website that implements many interactive features that allows users to create an account and utilize the practice 
                    tool in Algebra, Geometry, Combinatorics, and Number Theory, which consists of original problems of increasing difficulty. Includes various resources 
                    such as contest, programs, and website information, as well as a review module to go over past solved problems.

                    Work on the machine learning of clouds, using SPCAM Earth data on heat flux, solar radiation, humidity, etc. and coarse graining to generate predictive models of global 
                    temperature increase and climate change. I am reparameterizing and improving dropout algorithms in training NNCAM, the lab's current deep neural network. 
                    We are trying to improve robust fitting through stochastic methods and possibly a GAN in order to hopefully influence lawmakers involved in the Paris Agreement as 
                    well as serve as a model for various weather forecasting institutions across the globe.
