                    Hi! I'm Jesse, and I'm current freshman at Columbia University pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science. My main interests academically 
                    lie in applications in computer science to urban fields with real-world, positive social impact, such as computational spatial design or analysis of 
                    dyanmic urban education planning. However, I always enjoy learning new things across all STEM fields, such as genetic sequencing and splicing in biology, 
                    kinetics of reactions in chemistry, or even anlyzing equipotential surfaces in physics. I always enjoy my daily dose of exploring new topics through YouTube 
                    channels such as Numberphile or Vsauce (I highly recommend these creators to anyone interested in acquiring knowledge across a breadth of various scientific 
                    ideas and theories). <br><br>
                    Outside of class, I enjoy many things which are physically extensive, which includes weekly pickup basketball games with friends and working out (I'm stil 
                    trying to find the sweet spot when no one else is at Dodge). I'm a member of Uptown Local, Columbia's men's ultimate frisbee team, and I definitely enjoy 
                    getting a breather from schoolwork a couple times a week to launch up and grab the disc in the end zone. I'm also a developer at SpecTech of The Spectator, 
                    Columbia's weekly newspaper, and I work on anything from creating web pages for special events, such as Freshman Orientation, to Chrome extensions, such 
                    as Vergil+ and The Shaft, which enhance Columbia students' processes in course registration and dorm selection, respectively. Finally, I've always loved 
                    teaching, and I'm currently an instructor at Idea Math in NYC and a grader for AoPS, but I've worked for many places, including Mathnasium and Awesome 
                    Math as well as my own tutoring initiatives. In my free time, I absolutely love coming up with unique math contest problems.
